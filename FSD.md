# Fictional goggles - randomly named strategy game

## Overview

This is going to be a strategy game inspired by Conquest of Elysium. 
I've always wanted to try my hand at developing something similar, so I'll attempt at doing it completely on a website and in React. 
If this goes well, this might spark an interest in trying to clone other games that could easily run in the browser.

## 1. Purpose and scope

As in the overview, this is going to be a game similar to Conquest of Elysium.
It's not going to be a complete and balanced game, nowhere near the original, at least at first, it's just an experiment for seeing how far i can get
The development is going to be divided in various phases:

 - Phase 1: Developing a simple combat simulation
 - Phase 2: Developing an overworld mode of strategy
 - Phase 3: Developing an economy and buildings
 - Phase 4: Adding features like different environments, different races, etc.
 - Phase 5: Multiplayer? 

## 2. System overview

The whole game is going to be developed in React. If there is a need for a backend (this game is going to be single player for now), it will be developed in Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL
